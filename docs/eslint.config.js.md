# ESLint Configuration File

This file (`eslint.config.js`) is the configuration for ESLint, a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. This configuration helps maintain code quality, enforce coding standards, and avoid common errors.

## Key Components

- **`tseslint.config`**: The main function used to create the ESLint configuration. It takes an array of configuration objects.
- **`ignores`**: Specifies files and directories that ESLint should ignore. In this case, the `dist` directory (which typically contains build artifacts) is ignored.
- **`extends`**: An array of configurations that this configuration extends. It includes:
  - `js.configs.recommended`: The recommended rules from ESLint for JavaScript.
  - `tseslint.configs.recommended`: The recommended rules from `typescript-eslint` for TypeScript.
- **`files`**: A glob pattern that specifies which files this configuration object applies to. Here, it applies to all `.ts` and `.tsx` files.
- **`languageOptions`**: An object to configure JavaScript language options.
  - `ecmaVersion: 2020`: Allows for the parsing of modern ECMAScript features.
  - `globals: globals.browser`: Defines global variables that are available in a browser environment.
- **`plugins`**: An object that defines ESLint plugins to be used.
  - `'react-hooks'`: Enforces the rules of Hooks in React.
  - `'react-refresh'`: Enables "Fast Refresh" (also known as Hot Reloading) for React components.
- **`rules`**: An object to configure individual ESLint rules.
  - `...reactHooks.configs.recommended.rules`: Imports and applies the recommended rules from the `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` plugin.
  - `'react-refresh/only-export-components'`: This rule is a safety measure for React Refresh. It ensures that only components are exported from files, which is a requirement for React Refresh to work correctly. The `'warn'` level means it will show a warning instead of an error, and `{ allowConstantExport: true }` allows exporting constants from the same file as a component.

## How It Works

When you run ESLint on the project, it will use this configuration to check all `.ts` and `.tsx` files (except for those in the `dist` directory). It will enforce a set of recommended rules for both JavaScript and TypeScript, as well as specific rules for React Hooks and React Refresh. This helps to catch potential bugs, enforce best practices, and maintain a consistent code style throughout the project.
