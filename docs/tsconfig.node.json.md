# TypeScript Configuration for Node.js Environment

This file (`tsconfig.node.json`) is a specific TypeScript configuration file intended for files that run in a Node.js environment, such as build scripts and configuration files. It is referenced by the root `tsconfig.json` to ensure that these files are type-checked with the correct settings for Node.js.

## Key Sections

### `compilerOptions`

This object contains the specific rules and settings for the TypeScript compiler for the Node.js environment.

#### General Options
- **`target`: "ES2022"**: Specifies the ECMAScript target version. This is a recent version, suitable for modern Node.js environments.
- **`lib`: ["ES2023"]**: Lists the library files to be included in the compilation. This tells TypeScript to include type definitions for the latest ES2023 features.
- **`module`: "ESNext"**: Specifies the module system to be used. `ESNext` means it will use the latest supported ECMAScript module syntax, which is compatible with how Vite handles its configuration.

#### Module Resolution & Bundling
- **`skipLibCheck`: true**: Skips type checking of all declaration files (`.d.ts`). This can speed up compilation time.
- **`moduleResolution`: "bundler"**: This setting is designed to work with modern JavaScript bundlers like Vite, telling TypeScript to align with the bundler's module resolution strategy.
- **`allowImportingTsExtensions`: true**: Allows importing `.ts` files with their extensions, which is often necessary when `moduleResolution` is set to `bundler`.
- **`isolatedModules`: true**: Ensures that each file can be transpiled without relying on other files, which is a good practice for module-based projects.
- **`moduleDetection`: "force"**: This setting ensures that every file is treated as a module.
- **`noEmit`: true**: This is a critical setting. It tells the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) to only perform type checking and not to generate any JavaScript output files. The actual execution of the TypeScript configuration file is handled by Vite.

#### Linting & Strictness
- **`strict`: true**: Enables all strict type-checking options, which helps to catch a wide range of potential errors at compile time.
- **`noUnusedLocals`: true**: Reports an error for any local variable that is declared but not used.
- **`noUnusedParameters`: true**: Reports an error for any function parameter that is declared but not used.
- **`noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`: true**: Reports an error for fall-through cases in `switch` statements.

### `include`

- **`"include": ["vite.config.ts"]`**: This is a very important line. It explicitly tells the TypeScript compiler that this configuration should *only* be applied to the `vite.config.ts` file. This prevents the Node.js-specific settings from being accidentally applied to the application's source code.

## How It Works

This configuration file allows the project to have a different set of TypeScript rules for its Node.js-based tooling than for its browser-based application code. This is a common and recommended practice because the execution environments are different.

When you run a type check on the project, the root `tsconfig.json` directs the TypeScript compiler to use this `tsconfig.node.json` file to validate `vite.config.ts`. This ensures that the Vite configuration is type-safe and uses modern JavaScript features that are supported in the Node.js environment where Vite runs, without conflicting with the compiler settings needed for the React application code.
