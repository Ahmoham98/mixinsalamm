# Index HTML File

This file (`index.html`) is the main entry point for the web application. It's the first file that gets loaded when a user visits the website.

## Key Components

- **`<!doctype html>`**: This is the document type declaration, which tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document.
- **`<html lang="en">`**: The root element of the HTML page. The `lang="en"` attribute specifies that the language of the page is English.
- **`<head>`**: This section contains meta-information about the HTML document, which is not displayed on the page itself.
  - **`<meta charset="UTF-8" />`**: Specifies the character encoding for the document. UTF-8 is a universal character set that includes almost every character from all human languages.
  - **`<link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/vite.svg" />`**: This sets the "favicon" for the website, which is the small icon that appears in the browser tab.
  - **`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />`**: This is a crucial tag for responsive design. It tells the browser to set the width of the viewport to the width of the device, and to set the initial zoom level to 1.0. This ensures that the website looks good on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers.
  - **`<title>Vite + React + TS</title>`**: This sets the title of the web page, which is displayed in the browser tab and in search engine results.
- **`<body>`**: This section contains the content of the HTML document that is displayed to the user.
  - **`<div id="root"></div>`**: This is the main container where the React application will be mounted. The React code will find this `div` by its `id` and will render all the components inside it.
  - **`<script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>`**: This script tag loads and executes the main TypeScript file (`main.tsx`) that bootstraps the React application. The `type="module"` attribute is important as it allows the use of ES modules in the code.

## How It Works

When a user opens the website, the browser loads this `index.html` file. It then parses the `<head>` section to get information about the page. After that, it starts rendering the `<body>` section. The `<script>` tag at the end of the body tells the browser to download and execute the `/src/main.tsx` file. This file contains the React code that will take control of the `<div id="root">` element and render the entire user interface of the application.
